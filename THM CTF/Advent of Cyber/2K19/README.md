## The Story

Just before the lead up to Christmas, Santa’s company(The Best Festival Company) has been compromised by his nemesis(The Christmas Monster). Luckily, one of Santa’s elf team have a background in security. Can they recover all their systems before the lead up to Christmas?


It’s the evening of 30th November - the air in the arctic circle is filled with excitement, as every year. This year has been even smoother than previous years - Santa’s digitalisation program has made lives easier for everyone in the company. Elf McElferson, the CTO of the arctic circle, starts doing a couple of last minute checks; everything has to be operating successfully running up to Christmas. With her warm hot chocolate next to his desk, all she needs to do is open the health dashboard and grin at all the green lights. She enters the URL on the dashboard and leans in closer to the screen, anxiously waiting for confirmation. The page loads faster than expected and she gets the initial glimpse of all green. Wait, the first indicator moves to red, and every other one follows the same.

In less than a minute, she and all her colleagues receive the following email:

`Hey Crew! We know that this is the busiest time of your year. What a shame though - it looks like all of you are locked out of your systems and can’t do any work. Boo hoo for Christmas Santa’s Fav Nemesis, Christmas Monster`

McElferson jumps out of her seat and yells. This cannot be happening. How is she supposed to fix this - it’s only 25 days till Christmas and no one can do anything. She goes to the only person who knows about security on his team, Elf McSkidy(you), and asks them to use their l33t skills to fix this. They clearly have a big task ahead of themselves.
