# This Write Up is for the PICO CTF 2019 cryptography challenge - Flags

1. The input image can be found [here](https://github.com/pratty010/CTF/blob/master/PICO%20CTF/2K19/Crypto/Flags/flag.png).

2. After researching, I found that the code in their is for the [maritime flags](https://github.com/pratty010/CTF/blob/master/PICO%20CTF/2K19/Crypto/Flags/code.png) cryptography. 

3. We can use the following [decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/maritime-signals-code) to get the final flag as - `PIOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}`
